        Each colour of the rose has a specific significance. Yellow roses are meant for friendship. Pink roses signify poise, grace, gratitude, admiration, and more. They can also signify courtship when the love between the two is blooming. Unlike red roses which are meant for passionate love; pink roses can mean gentler love and mutual fondness.
