        <h1>3 Tips for Making a DIY Fresh Flower Bouquet</h1>
        <img src="../Images/Blog/blog image4.webp" alt="">

        <p>Fresh flowers are a fun and creative way to liven up your home or office. The splash of colour and vibrant scent can make any space feel more welcoming. While you can always purchase artisan made bouquets from places like Floristique, you should try building your own DIY bouquet. DIY bouquets allow you to customise the scent, colour scheme, and flowers in your bouquet. It's also a fun activity to do with friends or family. We've put together a simple guide from our trained florists to help you get started with building beautiful bouquets at home</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 1: Choose the flowers</h3>
        <p>A beautiful bouquet will start with the right flowers, but there are a few things you need to consider when planning which blooms will be central to your DIY bouquet:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Stick to a colour theme for the bouquet, and let this determine which flower you use. A colour theme will ensure the flowers complement each other to create a beautiful and cohesive piece. Choose colours that are similar for a more subdued look, or try contrasting colours for a vibrant statement.</li>
            <li>See what flowers are in season before you start buying flowers. This can help keep costs down as imported flowers will be more expensive. It also means you can support local flower merchants who source their blooms locally. A good place to start is with flowers that bloom all-year-round, like hydrangeas, and build you bouquet from there</li>
            <li>Choose durable flowers like succulents and daisies to ensure that your bouquet lasts for as long as possible. This is particularly important if the bouquet will be carried around all day, like a bridal bouquet. If you choose flowers with a shorter lifespan, you can preserve them yourself at home to keep them for longer</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h3>Step 2: Prepare the flowers</h3>
        <p>Depending on what flowers you choose, it may be necessary to remove any leaves and thorns. Roses will require particular care in this stem to ensure the thorny stems don't agitate surrounding flowers. Remove excess foliage as desired and cut the bottom of the stem at a diagonal to promote nutrients. Have a vase on hand ready to start building your bouquet. Have it filled with water and a little sugar or plant food to promote a healthy and long-lasting bouquet. Once all of this has been prepared, you can start to construct your bouquet!

        <h3>Step 3: Construct the bouquet</h3>
        <p>Now that everything is ready for you, you can start structuring the bouquet. This may take a few attempts as you figure out what works for you. It can be helpful to have a picture in front of you through this process for you to reference throughout. <br> First, start with the focal flowers and build around them. This way, the blooms will remain central to the piece and dictate the location of other flowers. <br> Hold your focal flowers upright as you begin to place the filler flowers. These will bulken the bouquet and provide a pleasant complement to the main flowers. Baby's Breath, Eucalyptus, and myrtle are popular options for filler flowers.  <br> Once everything is put together, wrap your bouquet using twine, florist's tape, or hot glue. This will ensure your arrangement remains where you've placed it. You can now place your DIY bouquet into a vase and feel satisfied with the work you've created.</p>
